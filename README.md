M.E.R.G.E.
===========
Senior Design Project at University of Michigan with Brian Fulper, Ryan Wawrzaszek, Kelly Dom, and myself, James Danielson.

Run gold.exe to play the game.

Simple cooperative unity game similar to asteroids, players must work together to defeat larger enemies by combining ships together. 

Players don't "die" you lose levels, and powerups, only lose by losing all planets.

You can't kill the bigger baddies without merging ships with at least one other player for more powerful shots.
